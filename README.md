# aoc2021
advent of code 2021 using Rust

I did this to get experience and fluency with the Rust language. This was also my first time ever doing AoC, so I wanted to see what it was all about. 
Overall I am happy with how it worked out. For a few days I needed help from Reddit, but mostly solved them myself. I feel pretty comfortable with Rust now,
although I am sure there is much I could have done "better" or must rust-idiomatic. I learned on day 24 that running with --release was 30 times faster
lol....

# Running the solutions
each solution is in a file src/{day-number}.rs, and you can run it like:
cargo run --release --bin {day-number} {part-number}(1 or 2)
Although not every solution ended up having distinct parts for 1 and 2.

The longest day to run is 24 part 1 (took about 4 minutes), but pretty much all other days run in a matter of seconds
