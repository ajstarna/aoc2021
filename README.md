# aoc2021
advent of code 2021 using Rust

I did this to get experience and fluency with the Rust language. This was also my first time ever doing AoC, so I wanted to see what it was all about. 
Overall I am happy with how it worked out. For a few days I needed help from Reddit, but mostly solved them myself. I feel pretty comfortable with Rust now,
although I am sure there is much I could have done "better" or must rust-idiomatic. I learned on day 24 that running with --release was 30 times faster
lol....
